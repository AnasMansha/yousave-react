                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  YouSave offers a robust set of filters and sorting options to
                  help you narrow down your search and find exactly what you're
                  looking for. Here's what to leverage:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-4 mb-4 space-y-2">
                  <li>
                    Price Range: Set a price range that fits your budget. This
                    eliminates irrelevant results, saving you valuable time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Brand: If you have a brand loyalty, or prefer a specific
                    store, filter results by your preferred brand(s).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Features: YouSave allows you to filter based on specific
                    features. For example, searching for a new TV might include
                    filtering by screen size, resolution, or smart TV
                    capabilities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Sorting Options: Sort results by different criteria, such as
                    price (low to high or high to low), and customer rating.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p className="pt-4 pb-4">
                  Furthermore, pre-setting your filters on your account, allows
                  you to set them up with 1 click instead of having to set them
                  up again every time. Click sign up to create a free account

                  Many shoppers only look at the first page of search results,

                    later in the search results.

                    stores with the highest inventory, while others with lower
                    stock might offer better deals. Looking further can lead to
